# Motivational Widgets ðŸ’¡  

This is a little experiment I built with the help of **AI** â€” I just wanted to see how far I could go making a project by leaning almost entirely on AI tools.  

The result: **motivational widgets** that display quotes from famous people and other inspirational lines. You can drop them into your workflow, customize them, or just open them up when you need a quick boost. ðŸš€  

## Why I Made This  
- Curiosity: *How much of a project can I make with AI assistance?*  
- Learning: Testing out how AI handles coding, design, and structuring a project.  
- Fun: Because who doesnâ€™t like a good motivational quote?  

## What It Does  
- Shows motivational quotes (famous people, general wisdom, etc.).  
- More of a concept/demo than a polished product.
